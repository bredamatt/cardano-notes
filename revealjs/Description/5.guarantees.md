# Blockchain Guarantees

---

## Liveness:

Liveness and persistence are prioritised and based on $u$ and $k$ parameters respectively. It is shown that they can only be violated with very low probabilities.

Liveness: If all honest nodes in the system attempt to include a certain transaction, then after the passing of time corresponding to $u$ slots (called the transaction confirmation time), all nodes, if queried and responding honestly, will report the transaction as stable.

Liveness is maintained in Cardano's block authoring mechanism by the following - Each slot that a node is assigned to produce a new block is only 1 second. If the node fails to produce a block in that time, the slot remains empty, and the next node is assigned to create the block. There could be major delays in block production if a large number of nodes are unable to produce blocks, concurrently, but that is highly unlikely.

However, there are no liveness guarantees for the governance model.

## Fairness:

In order to achieve a fair randomized election among stake-holders, entropy must be introduced into the system. They utilize a (simple) secure multiparty implementation of a coin-flipping protocol to produce the randomness for the leader election process (anti-grinding). 

The protocol assumes that parties can freely create accounts and receive and make payments, and that stake shifts over time.

## Censorship-resistance:

You can perform block withholding and/or endorsed input censorship to remove endorsed inputs from the blockchain that originate to honest parties. Then include the removed transactions in an endorsed input that will be transmitted in the last possible opportunity.

A possible direction for ameliorating this problem is to share the transaction fee of a transaction between all the input endorsers that endorsed it. This suggests the following modification to the protocol: whenever you are an input endorser you should attempt to include all transactions that you have collected for a sequence of $k$ slots and retransmit your endorsed input in case it is removed from the main chain.

## Safety:

Safety supplements liveness. Safety depends on the decentralization and partially on the number of validators in the system. The usage of "Stake Pools" enhances decentralization in the dPoS consensus mechanism, by making sure that it is more profitable for a single staking pool operator to maintain only one pool versus having many pools.
