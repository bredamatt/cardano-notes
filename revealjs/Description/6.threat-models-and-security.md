# Threat Models and Security

## Two things we liked about the security of Cardano

- The upgradability of cryptographic primitives, which allow for future quantum security. 

- Stake pools securing the PoS consensus protocol.

## Two things we disliked about the security of Cardano

- The total supply of ADA is very high compared to Bitcoin, which could lead to less fees being paid out to Validators, which in turn, could disincentivize them from participating in the network.

- Experts can act maliciously and collude with other experts in this regard in the treasury system.

## How does Cardano protect against common threats?

### Byzantine Generals Problem

Proof of Stake empowers the uncoordinated "Generals" to agree, based on the consensus mechanism, Ouroborous. Since there is a preset algorithm deciding which "General" is the leader, all the other "Generals" accept them as the leader, and by extension, accept the block that the leader creates, which can be verified to be valid.

### 51% Attack

No blockchain can prevent a 51% attack. Also, a BGP hijack (routing layer) can easily enable that - no protection mentioned.

### Sybil Attack

Ideally, the stake pool operator who controls a large amount of stake pools could control the entire network.

Sybil attacks are prevented in Cardano, by having the concept of "Pledging" of ADA by Stake Pool operators. By pledging a portion of their own funds, stake pool operators are entitled to having a bonus reward. By having a lower pledge, the stake pool operator obtains a smaller reward. This incentivizes stake pool operators to have a higher pledge, thereby, discouraging them from creating multiple stake pools.

### Selfish Mining Attach
This is prevented by the rewards mechanism - the input endorsers can receive rewards a long period after the contribution happened.

### Nothing At Stake Attack (and Past Majority Attack)
Prevented by the randomness of the next block creator. Also if stakeholders are online sufficiently often, any deep fork from the last recieved block is ignored.

## Secure Transactions 
Cardano uses the following to provide secure transactions:

- Deterministic Finality

- eUTXO - prevents double spending, secured by a chain of signatures

TODO: Immutability, nothing has been found to prove the claim of Cardano that there is finality after 36 hours.
