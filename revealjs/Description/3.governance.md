# Governance

Governance in the blockchain space could mean many different things, but in this case, it refers specifically to how the platform's community can shape the evolution of the blockchain system. 

One way we can assess the "value" of a particular governance model is to use the more recently devised Blockchain Governance framework from IOHK: [Blockchain Governance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07188.pdf). This should help us analyse the quality of any Blockchain Governance framework through a specific set of desirable properties. Here, there are 7 properties we can base our evaluation on:

1. Suffrage
2. Pareto Efficiency
3. Confidentiality
4. Verifiability
5. Accountability
6. Sustainability
7. Liveness

Before we analyse Cardano's Governance system let us define  why we need a governance system to begin with.

## Purpose

For any ecosystem to have a sustainable future, it is necessary to govern the system's evolution. Yet the key point is to figure out in which direction the ecosystem is evolving (to something better, or worse?). Because Cardano is software, a core component of Cardano's governance model is to ensure that the platform, and its related tools and projects evolve sustainably.However, Blockchain systems push software governance to the limit since their ecosystems are more like communities with financial incentives, very much like our everyday economy. Hence, one may also argue that sustainable governance of the Cardano ecosystem is somewhat tied to the sustainable growth of its financial system.

In general, governance problems arise whenever it becomes rational for an individual actor to game / play the system for his/her own benefit at the expense of the common good of the community. Hence, we could say that a particular governance system is good only as far as it makes it rational for system participants to act in the interest of the common good. A well-designed governance mechanism would also be capable of incentivizing agents, or at least indirectly making them act in the interest of the common good, even when it may initially appear rationally not to, or when they may attempt to deviate from the common good.

In general, however, we can say that a governance system is focused on maximizing the utility of its community members by guaranteeing that the 7 definitions are satisfied, so we may generally state that there could be an optimal fucntion $\lambda$ that maximizes the utility of the community $U$, given some definition $x_{i}$ for $i \in [1,...,7]$. This would however require us to know how to maximize each individual definition, and as will be clear, is not necessarily that straightforward as these definitions are somewhat interrelated.

## Blockchain Governance definitions

### 1. Suffrage

*"The right to participate
in decision making procedures."*

Rights may be provided in various ways:

- mining based (hashing power)
- token based (token owenership)
- identity based (identity verification)

### 2. Pareto Efficiency

*"A blockchain governance system is Pareto efficient if whenever a decision-making process is held, alternative X cannot win if there exists another alternative Y that is preferred by at least one participant, and no participant prefers X over Y."*

Think of this as the outcome of a voting process being the "best" possible outcome of the set of outcomes that could occur.

### 3. Confidentiality

- Type 1: "Secrecy":

*"A blockchain governance system satisfies secrecy if whenever a decision-making process is held, an adversary cannot guess the input of any participant better than an adversarial algorithm whose only inputs are the overall tally and, if the adversary is a participant, the adversaryâ€™s input."*

- Type 2: "Pseudonymity":

*"A blockchain governance system satisfies pseudonymity if no participant is required to reveal their real-life identity to participate in the decision-making processes"*

Where Type 1 is stronger than Type 2. 

### 4. (End-to-End) Verifiability

*"A blockchain governance system is verifiable if whenever a decision-making process takes place, participants are able to verify their inputs were properly tallied and independent observers are able to verify that inputs from eligible participants were properly tallied."*

Usually, split between:
- individual (voter can verify their vote was created, stored and tallied correctly)
- global (everyone can verify that only valid votes are in the ballot box, and that all stored votes are properly tallied)

### 5. Accountability

*"A blockchain governance system satisfies the property of accountability if whenever participants bring in a change, they are held individually responsible for it in a clearly defined way by the platform."*

Think of this as "Skin-in-the-Game". Parties participating in the governance system are incentivized to do good because they themselves are accountable for their own profits/rewards.

### 6. Sustainability

- Type 1: "Development":
*"A blockchain governance system sustains development if it incentivises, via monetary rewards or otherwise, participants who develop successful improvement proposals for the platform"*

- Type 2: "Participation":
*"A blockchain governance system sustains participation if it incentivises, via monetary rewards or otherwise, participants who participate in the decision-making process of the platform"*

### 7. Liveness

*"A blockchain governance system satisfies liveness if it is capable of incorporating an input of urgency from the stakeholders and then being capable of acting on it in the sense that if an issue is deemed to be urgent according to some function, then the decision making procedure is capable of terminating within a reasonable amount of time, as a function of the urgency of the matter."*

More broadly stated, liveness implies two things:
- the governance system continues to operate indefinitely,
- in case of an emergency, there are procedures in place that can bring it back to life

  - Majority go offline before the next pre-voting epoch
  - The seed for the next round of voting is not decrypted

## Exploring Cardano's Governance system

To understand the governance terminology in Cardano better, let us break down some important concepts. 

### Funding Proposals vs Cardano Improvement Proposals

Cardano's governance system is centred on a collective decision making process which is meant to solve which future projects to support. However, there are indeed two different governing bodies:
- The Cardano community (decentralized)
- The Cardano Foundation (more centralized)

Each of these governing bodies focus on different types of proposals in the Cardano ecosystem, namely:
- Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), and
- Funding Proposals (FP)

The CIPs are entirely managed by the Cardano Foundation, whereas solely FPs are eligible for the community to decide upon. This indicates that there is to some degree an aspect of centralization remaining in Cardano's governance system, at least the implementation of Cardano's blockchain layer. 

It has been mentioned that CIPs will also be governed by the community, but it is unclear when. Regardless of the truthfulness of the latter statement, it is near impossible to claim that the decision to make CIPs subject to public voting is made in a decentralized manner. Because most of the documentation related to Cardano's governance framework targets FPs, we focus our analysis on the governance process used by the Cardano community.

### Funding Proposals

To contribute to the sustainable evolution of the Cardano ecosystem, community members are eligible to submit funding proposals. These proposals represents projects to be built on top of the Cardano blockchain, and generally to be funded by the collective treasury (more on this below).

Generally, all system participants may have ideas about how the system should evolve, but not all of them may know what is in the ecosystem's best interest. Additionally, not all funding proposals may be in the best interst of the community.

The most obvious incentive for community members to participate in the Cardano ecosystem is to make the Cardano ecosystem better. What this "better" implies, however, is not very clear, as highlighted by the function $\lambda$ above, which could potentially leave room for obfuscating malintent.
 
As we learned from the collective decision making games in class, even if on the average it is rational to contribute to the common good when you participate in the community for a long periodof time, it is not necessarily the case that all participants want to participate forever. Also, as in any collective society, selfish interests may lead to conflicting interest between community members, which by nature leads to suboptimal collective outcomes. Therefore, one may argue that any good governance system has to make sure that the collective good provides enough utility for each individual on the average to be incentivized to participate in order to satisfy the sustainability of participation criteria.

### Is the treasury system implemented?

A core question we tried to answer was the extent to which the treasury system is implemented. According to the [Treasury system paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf), Cardano's Voltaire release will contain its implementation. Currently, however, there exists a publicly available governance interface, namely [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.org/). This is an online platform where community members can learn about how to come up with their own proposals, vote, and assess proposals accordingly. This looks very similar to the ideas discussed in the academic paper, but there appeared to be a few discrepencies. As such, we decided to base our analysis on the paper rather than Project Catalyst.

Still, it was important for us to see how easy it was to sign up to and participate in the Cardano Community to assess the extent to which suffrage is solved for the Blockchain governance system. Therefore, we signed up to Project Catalyst as a standard user so we could evaluate the governance system's practicalities in more detail.

Unfortunately, we were unable to propose a new project because the deadline had passed, but there was a well-defined interface for doing so, and we quickly found out the different stages/rounds from project ideation to funding a particular "governance round" (as Catalyst calls it) consists of. 

The rounds defined on Catalyst's platform were:

- Proposal
- Review
- Finalize
- Assessment
- Assess QA
- Governance (AKA voting phase)

#### Catalyst periods

*Proposal period*:
- A fixed period of time where project proposals are welcome

*Proposal review period*
- A fixed period of time where proposals are reviewed 

*Proposal finalization period*
- A fixed period of time where proposals are finalized and prepared for assessment

*Proposal assessment period*
- A fixed period of time where proposals are assessed by project assessors

*Assessment Quality Assurance period*
- A fixed period of time where the quality assurance of the assessment period is established

*Governance period*
- A fixed period of time, divided into three epochs:
  - Pre-voting epoch
  - Voting epoch
  - Post-voting epoch

Inactive proposals are eventually archived. The definition of inactive is unclear.

#### Voltaire periods

In the Voltaire period, the number of rounds dedicate dto:

- Pre-voting / setup,
- Voting,
- Post-voting,

Hence it is clear that there are some differences between Catalyst and Voltaire. It seems additional focus has been placed on review and QA in Catalyst, potentially due to the fact that it is not as secure as Voltaire would be, but this is not easy to say from the sources we have available.

#### Pre-voting

During the pre-voting stage, two things happen:

- projects are proposed as described above, and
- voters and experts register by submitting special transactions on the blockchain including a security deposit that locks up some stake for the governance round.

Registration is supported in various ways, such as through: 

- Daedalus Mainnet (desktop, Ledger Nano S and X, Trezor T)
- Yoroi mobile (iOS and Android, Ledger Nano S)
- Yoroi browser extension (desktop, Ledger Nano S and X)
- AdaLite-Ledger (desktop, hardware wallet, no mobile support)
- AdaLite-Trezor (desktop, hardware wallet, no mobile support)
- Adalite-Mnemonics (desktop, software wallet)
- Typhon Wallet
- CCVault
- Hardware wallet via CLI interface + Guide
- VotingTools CLI

In other words, voters and experts can regiter in a variety ways with various security properties, providing them flexibility to do so based on their peferences.

There also exists a set of applications that are available on laptop, browser and smart phone for voting purposes. Details can be found here: ["Catalyst Registration and Voting Guide"](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide).

It is worthwhile mentioning that voters need at least 500 ADA as a security deposit to join a funding round. This is not mentioned in the paper, but is nevertheless highlighted in the voting guide above. This influences suffrage since not everyone can afford this fee. Nevertheless, it is not extremely high, and could also be a security property to make the cost of disrupting the outcome significant enough. For example, if you could vote with just 1 ADA (and price of 1 ADA is $1.50), it would imply a significant interest in stake, where majority may not necessarily hold enough ADA / stake to truly care about the optimal outcome for the collective.

#### Voting 

During the voting epoch there are three main things for the participants to do:

- committe selection stage,
- distributed key setup stage for committee members, 
- ballot casting stage for voters and experts,

#### Post-voting 

The post-voting stage consists of a:

- tally stage (when votes are counted by the committee)
- execution stage

To tally votes, committee members need to decrypt them. Hence, secrecy / privacy is not satisified at a global level.

### The treasury system

As mentioned, Cardano uses a treasury-model for collective decision making purposes. This means that the community collectively decies how to use the funds in the treasury to fund project proposals.

Currently, even if Voltaire is still WIP, the treasury is live. According to Catalyst, Cardano's treasury system is on Funding round 9 (usually listed as FUND9). The data surrounding the treasury, and its overall funding history, is relatively transparent, but not necessarily easy to understand in relation to the documentation that exists. The data is generally shared through a shared Google Doc, which is publicly readable, but terminology is defined across various information sources making it not that straightforward to understand what the numbers mean. See for example: ["Catalyst announcement"](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/09/16/project-catalyst-introducing-our-first-public-fund-for-cardano-community-innovation/).

As mentioned, Cardano uses a treasury system to govern the evolution of the protocol, however Cardano was not the first platform to do so (the Dash governance system invented the treasury model in the blockchain space apparently). In a treasury system, the collective decides upon where funding is allocated. That being said, the funds have to arrive from somewhere, hence there exists a set of funding mechanisms to make the governance system sustainable.

#### Cardano treasury funding mechanisms

In the Cardano governance system, the treasury is funded in three different ways:

1. when new blocks are minted, a proportion of the rewards goes to the treasury
2. miners' rewards are taxed, and the tax is collected by the treasury
3. donations, or charity are also possible venues of funding proposals

It has been shown (see the Treasury link above) that the treasury appears to be growing in value. This could be interpreted in various ways, but one clear way would be to state that the current funding mechanisms are overestimating the fund requirements. Since it is not clearly documented who owns the private keys for the treasury accounts, however, it is easy to become skeptical about what would happen in  worst case scenario (as in say the Cardano ecosystem becomes subject to regulatory scrutiny and all ecosystem participation becomes illegal for example).

### Voltaire in detail

For this analysis we will focus on the design outlined in this paper: ["A Treasury System for Cryptocurrencies:
Enabling Better Collaborative Intelligence"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/435.pdf).

First and foremost Voltaire is designed to utilize a *fuzzy threshold voting system*. In such a system there is a ranking of proposals based on the number of votes *for* each proposal, minus the number of votes *against*, whilst checking that the remainder is at least 10% of all votes recorded to make sure that it isn't arbitrary which proposal is favoured (ie. there needs to be some threshold for proposals to "win" a funding round). This is to make sure that only those proposals which win by a certain degree of certainty are funded. 

Additionally, the voting system provides a set of metrics estimated per voting phase to provide feedback to voters as to how far away their vote is from the community's sentiment. This feedback loop gives community members the ability to sense the extent to which they may need to adjust their preferences to align with the community, and arguably push the outcome towards a Pareto efficient outcome, under the assumptions they are acting "good". Alternatively, a malicious community member could also use it as a way to optimize towards selfish behavior. 

Now that we know at a high level how the voting system works, we should evaluate the incentives of voters, experts and committee members to act for the common good in the Cardano governance system.

### Voters

These are community members who decides to vote on the projects proposed in a particular funding round. They do this by depositing an amount of ADA as a security deposit in the pre-voting phase. The more they deposit, the more voting power they have, in other words, their voting power is proportional to their stake. 

Still, it is possible that an inexperienced voter with large degree of stake disrupts the funding round by accidentally, or deliberately voting for a suboptimal proposal from a Pareto efficiency perspective. Yet, the extent to which voters with large stake would not want the best result for the collective is questionable since a bad outcome is something they would lose from.  Additionally, there are opportunities to delegate stake to a funding round "expert", and this delegation mechanism is particularly valuable to give unknowledgable, but what may potentially be disruptive voters (by accident in this case) the ability to reach Pareto optimality to a greater extent.

In summary, it seems that the future Cardano governance system aims to implement *liquid democracy* to partially solve the problem of votes being passed **accidentally** to Pareto inefficient proposals. Because it is a choice whether to delegate, or not, there are *no guarantees* of Pareto efficiency as a consequence.

#### Voter rewards

Voters are rewarded proportional to the amount they deposited. As in traditional governance systems, this will naturally lead to a stronger degree of centralization with time since voters who deposit larger values are also rewarded accordingly. 

Generally, there is no clear logical conncetion between centralization and a lack of ecosystem sustainability. Many systems which are relatively centralized could exhibit sustainable behavior. Indeed, if the system's sustainability is harmed by centralisation, it tends to be a consequence of corrupt decision-makers rather than centralisation per se. In other words, ineffiency could be a indirect consequence of centralisation, but not always a direct one.

Furthermore, the exact cause of corruption is not always clear in centralised systemsd, but would generally be stated to be the outcome of there existing some rational decision existing which incentivizes an agent *enough* to deviate from the Pareto efficient goal for the collective. Thus, there could be some correlation between maximizing collective utility and decentralization as long as it is decentralized *enough*, where any central decision maker's swaying power does not provide *enough* guarantees for profiting from a deviation. Therefore, it is important that a governance system satisfies the suffrage definition, and makes participating in the protocol easy. As mentioned, it was very straightforward to sign up to Catalyst, and as it is possible to delegate to experts (see below).

However, suffrage per se is not representative enough as a measure of decentralization in the Cardano goverance system since voting power is based on the amount of ADA a particular voter deposits. That being said, a single voter would need to have a significant amount of ADA to skew the votes such that the result is in their favour, and the probability of one individual voter owning that much ADA is quite small (nevertheless possible). Alternatively, he/she would need to collude with a significant number of other voters to disrupt the Pareto efficent outcome of the funding round. Furthermore, this becomes less likely the more participants there are in the system. Recent figures indicate more than 250,000 participants in the last funding round, therefore we argue that it is difficult, to convince a significant enough number of participants to deviate from the collective good of Cardano's ecosystem once they signed up to it.

### Experts

As mentioned, Cardano uses a liquid democracy for their collective decision making. Experts are those voters who also receive "delegated stake". Therefore, if anyone has incentives to skew the vote, it would be experts with significant delegated stake since they would potentially have enough voting power to influence the funding round's outcome.

An interesting feature of the expert is that it also facilitates greater participation in the governance system, since anyone who holds some ADA can participate in the funding round, and simply delegate their votes to an expert. As such, it seems like a reasonable approach to guarantee participation sustainability as it lowers the knowledge barrier requirement for meaningful participation.

#### Expert rewards

Similarly to how voters are rewarded proportionally to their stake, experts are rewarded proportionally to the sum of their delegated stake. This means that to truly benefit as an expert in the Cardano ecosystem, experts really need to be viewed as such for voters to trust them with their stake. Furthermore, this creates an incentive to become knowledgable about the ecosystem - since the likelihood of reaping participation rewards are significantly higher as an expert than as a voter. 

Still, an expert could socially engineer a large set of voters to trust him/her and deviate from his/her "promises" if they are more knowledgeable, but in the long-run, such a tactic may not work as the likelihood of being caught is large. Indeed, it would be more rational to maintain a dominant position as a "more than average" knowledgeable person and reap consistent reweards, than to potentially reap high rewards once.

Interestingly enough, experts are also free to delegate their accumulated votes to other experts. This means that there are situations were a subset of the total set of experts end up with significant stake, at which point they may be incentivized to deviate to greater degree. 

### Committee

The committee is crucial for the Cardano governance system. Think of the committee as being analagous to miners in a generic blockchain consensus system as both miners and the committee makes sure the system satisfies the liveness criteria of the protocol.

There is a difference however. In Cardano, there are up to `k` randomly chosen committee members, but there is only `1` randomly selected block author per round in the blockchain consensus layers. The committee members in the treasury system is not to produce blocks, but rather to tally the votes committed by experts and voters and guarantee that no other committee members lies. Consequently, they are crucial for maintaining Cardano's governance system's "verifiability" and "sustainability" concerns.

That being said, the consensus algorithm used to agree on a particular tally amongst the `k` committee members differs from that of agreeing on a particular block, and is actually rather involved.

### Evaluating the behavior of committee members

As mentioned, the more interesting aspects of the committee members behavior is best analysed during the governance period. This period consists of three different epochs:

1. Pre-voting/preparation stage,
2. Voting stage, and
3. Post-voting stage

### Cryptographic primitives

The primitives used in governance are highlighted [here](../Cryptography.md). 


## Summary

Cardano's treasury system is complex, and difficult to evalaute as there is a lack of easily-accessible documentation about its current state. 

Although information is possible to find in the academic paper, and more generally, on the Project Catalyst page, most of the implementation is aimed to reach Voltaire - the final iteration of Cardano, which is yet to be released.

That being said, there is a lot of research which has gone into designing the Cardano governance model, such as:

- Secure liquid democracy model,
- Treasury system,
- Delegated stake,
- Fuzzy voting,
- Secure distributed key generation protocol, and
- Non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZK)

When put together, these paradigms leads to a powerful ecosystem where there are incentives to participate.
