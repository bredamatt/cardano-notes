### Usage

The native token can be used as digital currency on the platform for fee payment, deposits and receiving rewards.

Users can earn a share of block rewards by (delegated) staking of tokens, which are used to secure the network.
Users can also interact with decentralized apps (DApps) through a recent release of general-purpose smart contract
functionality[^2]. Finally, users can also vote on project funding and network improvements, with votes weighted by
stake.
