#  Introduction

---
[Cardano](https://cardano.org) is a third generation "proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on
peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods"[^1]. It defines itself as "a financial system
that accepts its social nature" and a financial stack for the developing/unbanked world.

The whitepaper can be found at https://whitepaper.io/document/581.

### Core Offerings
Cardano's core offerings are as follows:

- Formal verification/strong proofs a core feature of Cardano (formal methods to achieve strong guarantees)
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake as a consensus mechanism
- Decentralised funding mechanism
- Separation of concerns: separation of settlement (value transfer) and computation layers (smart contracts)
- Regulation
    - Strong guarantees of fraud-free commerce through smart contracts and settlement layer
    - Enriching of transactions through optional metadata: labeling of transactions and financial activity
    - Authentication and Compliance
        - Sealed Glass Proofs to submit compliance information to verifier who is forced to comply with policies 
          submitted under, protecting the information from leaks

### Usage
The native token can be used as digital currency on the platform for fee payment, deposits and receiving rewards.

Users can earn a share of block rewards by (delegated) staking of tokens, which are used to secure the network.
Users can also interact with decentralized apps (DApps) through a recent release of general-purpose smart contract
functionality[^2]. Finally, users can also vote on project funding and network improvements, with votes weighted by
stake.

### Differentiation
The differentiating factors of the project are as follows:
- Liquid Democracy for Governance
- Staking Pools for Consensus
- Separation of settlement and computation layers for increased flexibility and security
- eUTXO model: transaction model provides enhanced security (each transaction has different address), scalability 
  (transaction parallelism), and determinism (off-chain validation and accurate fee prediction)[^2]
