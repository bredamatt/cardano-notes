# Economics

---

**Goal:** Evaluate the use of tokenomics in this project; name at least two things you like and two things you would want to improve.

* Use at least 3 of the following economic concepts in your answer:
    * Market Equilibrium (Supply and Demand): 
      * What is the supply schedule of the token, does it have inflation or deflation? 
      * Who will want to use the coin, and for what?
    * Economic Specialization
    * Game Theoretical Models
    * Auction Mechanics and Price Discovery Methods

## Tokenomics

### Native coin
ADA, named after Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician[^1].

### Tokenomics:
What are the tokenomics of the coin?

- Token presale of 25.9 billion ADA, additional 5.2 billion ADA (20% of public) allocated to three entities supporting 
  development: [IOHK](https://iohk.io) (2.6 billion), [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io) (2.07 billion) and the [Cardano 
  Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org) (0.684 
  billion)[^2]
- Top 100 addresses on network hold ~17% circulating supply[^3]

| Supply      | ADA               |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Initial     | 31.8 billion      |
| Circulating | 33.93 billion[^4] |
| Total       | 45 billion        |

- decreasing inflation (todo: describe reduction in block rewards)

### Rewards
How is the coin earned?

#### Staking:
  - pool operators set own fees
  - 24.5b ADA staked across ~3200 pools (~70% circulating supply), with ~1.1m delegators[^3]
  - designed to be decentralised through saturation parameter ("parameter K"), whereby pool has a saturation point 
    (cap) at which it no longer earns rewards

## Economic Incentives
How does this project use economic incentives to drive behavior?
