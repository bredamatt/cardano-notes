## Collective Decision Making
How does this project solve the collective decision making problem?

## Governance Structures
What are the structures of governance in this project? How are changes proposed and voted on?

Cardano aims to be decentralized as a "core value", but currently relies on traditional co-ordination mechanisms for 
governance until the planned on-chain treasury system is implemented in the Voltaire Era [^1].

### Improvement Proposals
- Improvement proposals are currently managed via a Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIP) [^2]

### Funding Proposals

#### Project Catalyst
A stop-gap solution for proposing projects for funding, using the IdeaScale platform[^3], with some similarities to 
the final on-chain treasury system:
- ADA holders propose projects by connecting Daedalus wallet or Catalyst voting app
- Stakeholders register to vote on a proposal, where voting power weighted to ADA held 

#### Voltaire
The Voltaire Era will introduce an on-chain treasury system which:

  - todo: go into specifics
  - Funding Proposals
