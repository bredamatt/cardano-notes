# Governance

---
### How does this project solve the collective decision making problem?

The collective decision making problem appears in two different places for the Cardano community's governance system:

- The commmunity must collectively decide on funding proposals (FP)
- The Cardano foundation collectively (we hope) decides on Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs)
- We focus on FPs

---
### Funding proposals

- Community members can contribute funding proposals on a platform called Project Catalyst (this is off-chain)

- Decision regarding which proposals to support is solved primarily by using three/four "structures":
    - Liquid democracy
    - Treasury system
    - Cryptography 
    - Sidechain (Voltaire)

- Rewards are introduced to sustain participation, and they are proportional to stake 

### How are changes proposed and voted on?

- Three stages (Pre-voting, Voting, Post-voting)

- Four primary participants:
    - Project proposers 
    - Voters 
    - Experts
    - Committee members

### Who is allowed to vote in this project? What are the voting criteria?

- Voters and experts are allowed to vote
- Voting power is propotional to stake
- Any Cardano community member who can deposit/stake a minimum of 500 ADA (Cardano's native token) per round is eligible

---
### Treasury funding mechanism
- The treasury is used as a decentralized trust, and is funded in three different ways:
    - By taxing block authors' rewards (decentralized)
    - By transferring a fixed portion of the block rewards to the treasury accounts (decentralized)
    - Through donations (external, ie. not part of the protocol)

---
### What voting mechanisms are used in this project?

- Liquid democracy
    - A blend of direct and representative democracy.
    - Voters can vote directly for proposals, or delegate to experts.
    - Experts receive delegated stake, and can delegate their previously received stake to other experts if necessary.

- Why liquid democracy?
    - Improve Pareto efficiency (optimal outcome)
        - Uninformed voters can still contribute positively by delegating to someone more knowledgable
    - Encourage developing expertise
        - Higher rewards as experts, but still bound by upper limit

---
- Fuzzy threshold voting
    - Ranks each proposal based on:

        ***Remainder = (Votes for  - Votes against ) % Total number of votes***
        
    - Remainder must be > 10% of all votes recorded for a proposal to be shortlisted for funding

---

### The Committee

- Committee members are primarily responsible for tallying votes, and guaranteeing liveness of the governance system. 
- Committee members are elected voters, where the probability of being elected is relative to the amount staked.
- To maintain trust in committee members, a set of cryptographic primitives are used.

---
### Cryptography used by Committee members

- Security properties of cryptographic hash functions
    - The committee election phase is based on them (pre-image attack resistance primarily)
- Distributed Key Genereation with threshold
- Non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZK)

The last two are combined to verify that community members are acting honestly.

### What we liked about the Cardano governance system

- Interesting and innovative cryptographic research and protocols
- The introduction of liquid democracy into an e-voting system

---
### What we didn't like 

- Implementation vs. theoretical paper
    - Lack of trust in Project Assessors in Catalyst
    - Some proposals have been found to be generated by bots to siphon funds out of the treasury
- Seemed to be a few issues regarding committee members:
    - Appears possible to maliciously complain about honest committee members during DKG protocol
    - No theoretical guarantee for termination if committee members are byzantine, and/or crash
