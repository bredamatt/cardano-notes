# 3. Governance

---

### How does this project solve the collective decision making problem?

- By using:
    - Liquid democracy
    - Treasury system
    - Cryptography 

- The cryptography establishes guarantees that votes are not tampered with.
- The treasury is used as a decentralized trust. 
- The result of a vote in the liquid democracy system determines how the funds in the treasury are spent.

---

### How are changes proposed and voted on?

- Four primary participants in a governance round:
    - Project proposers
    - Voters
    - Experts
    - Committee members

- The amount of stake deposited by a participant determines the amount of voting power each participant has (voters and experts only)

- Committee members are primarily responsible for tallying votes, and guaranteeing liveness of the governance system.
